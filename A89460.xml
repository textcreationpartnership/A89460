            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">S</seg>Uch are the ſeverall diſtempers and diſtracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of this Kingdome, that former ages could hardly paralell the like. Every day produces heavy newes, and ſad novelties of warres, and rumours of wars, proceeding from the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party of this Kingdome, ſuch as are open and profeſt enemies to the peace of great Brittaine; and ſuch (I am ſure) as beare no good will to Sion, nor to the tranquility of Jeruſalem. What hainous, and never the like heard of inſolencies they have already acted? what impudent affronts they have offred the Kings Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtie, and his good government? what horrid plots and hideous conſpiracies they have contrived and attempted, both by For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigne invaſion and domeſtick inſurrection, the hiſtory of theſe times doth ſufficiently teſtifie.</p>
            <p>The great Councell of the King and this Kingdome (the high and honourable Court of Parliament now aſſembled) have beene credibly within theſe few daies enformed of 8000. men, which are ſpeedily to be ſent from <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> towards the Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therne parts: What the deſignes of thoſe two Kings are, none can

               <!-- PDF PAGE 99 -->as yet tell; God only knowes, and we may all certainely ſuppoſe that they doe intend no good to this little Iſland of ours: They (being of another Religion) have beene heretofore, and will bee ſtill adverſaries to us, and emulators of our proſperity. Beſides theſe, the two Houſes have had intelligence of late of Armes and Ammunition to be tranſported to New Caſtle, with many Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines and Cavalliers (who are ſhrewdly ſuſpected to be the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignant Party) whoſe deſignes have beene malevolent, and (tis much feared) will be little better towards the peace and welfare of the Kingdome of <hi>England,</hi> and this City of London.</p>
            <p>There hath been likewiſe a Report made to the upper and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Houſe of Parliament, how that the Popes Nuncio hath gone about to raiſe forces for the aforeſaid deſignes; and to that end, that he might effect, and the better accompliſh his attempts, hee hath ſollicited the two Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spaine</hi> to lend the King of <hi>England</hi> foure thouſand men a piece. There hath beene likewiſe a Report made (and it was in a Letter ſent from <hi>Holland,</hi> which was read in the Houſe of Commons) that the Queenes Majeſty had provided certaine Ships laden with Ammunition, with a purpoſe and reſolution to goe in them towards the North: As alſo the Lord <hi>Digby</hi> that was impeacht by the Parliament, of high Treaſon, with Maſter <hi>Piercy</hi> (the Earle of Northumberlands brother) Maſter <hi>Termine,</hi> and divers others that runne away the laſt yeare, are all a comming over (as they ſay) with a great Fleet from <hi>Denmarke.</hi> And (if Fame be true, and we may give credit to a printed Pamphlet which this day came forth) there have beene ſtrokes given, and bullets ſhot here in <hi>England,</hi> which is lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to conſider that there ſhould be Civill Warres at this time amongſt us. Upon the fourth day of this inſtant Month of July, there was a skirmiſh between the Lord <hi>Strange</hi> and the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of Mancheſter in Lancaſhire; the occaſion whereof was (as that Booke makes mention) through the Lord <hi>Stranges</hi> Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to take away their Magazine by force, having received for that purpoſe many forces from Yorke. Tis very ſtrange, if this be true;

If this be the beginning of Civill Warre, God knowes (and no mortall but he) when the ending will be: When that dreadfull time is once come (as God forbid it ever ſhould) many a weake wife will bee husbandleſſe, and many a poore childe fatherleſſe: Then will be mourning and lamentation in our Cities and Countries, many <hi>Rachels</hi> mourning for their children, becauſe they are not: Many thouſands will then loſe their lives before that this Kingdome be agine ſetled in peace.</p>
            <p>A Civill Warre will teare in pieces our flouriſhing Kingdome, be a meanes for the invaſion of a forraigne foe, expoſing us to the fury and deriſion of our enemies, to the pitty and deploration of our friends. <hi>Bellum Dei fl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#OXF" extent="1 letter">
